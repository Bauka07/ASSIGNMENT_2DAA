## 1. Algorithm Overview (1 page)

### 1.1 Introduction
Insertion Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It is particularly efficient for small datasets and nearly-sorted data.

### 1.2 Algorithm Description
The algorithm works by:
1. Dividing the array into sorted and unsorted regions
2. Iteratively selecting elements from the unsorted region
3. Inserting each element into its correct position in the sorted region
4. Shifting elements as necessary to make room

### 1.3 Theoretical Background
- **Category:** Comparison-based, in-place sorting
- **Stability:** Stable (preserves relative order of equal elements)
- **Adaptivity:** Highly adaptive to pre-sorted data
- **Use Cases:** Small arrays, nearly-sorted data, online sorting

### 1.4 Optimizations in Partner's Implementation
*(Document the specific optimizations Abylaikhan implemented)*
- Binary insertion optimization
- Sentinel value usage
- Early termination for sorted portions
- Gap-based insertion for nearly-sorted data

## 2. Complexity Analysis (2 pages)

### 2.1 Time Complexity Analysis

#### 2.1.1 Best Case: O(n)
**Scenario:** Array is already sorted

**Analysis:**
- Outer loop: n iterations
- Inner loop: 1 comparison per iteration (no shifts)
- Total comparisons: n - 1
- Total operations: Θ(n)

**Mathematical Justification:**
```
T(n) = Σ(i=1 to n-1) [1 comparison]
     = n - 1
     = Θ(n)
```

#### 2.1.2 Worst Case: O(n²)
**Scenario:** Array is reverse sorted

**Analysis:**
- Outer loop: n iterations
- Inner loop: i shifts for iteration i
- Total comparisons: n(n-1)/2

**Mathematical Justification:**
```
T(n) = Σ(i=1 to n-1) [i comparisons + i shifts]
     = 2 × [1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n-1)]
     = 2 × n(n-1)/2
     = n(n-1)
     = Θ(n²)
```

#### 2.1.3 Average Case: Θ(n²)
**Scenario:** Random permutation

**Analysis:**
- On average, each element is compared with half the sorted portion
- Expected comparisons: n²/4
- Total operations: Θ(n²)

**Mathematical Justification:**
```
T(n) = Σ(i=1 to n-1) [i/2 comparisons on average]
     = (1/2) × n(n-1)/2
     = n(n-1)/4
     = Θ(n²)
```

### 2.2 Space Complexity Analysis

#### 2.2.1 Auxiliary Space
- **In-place sorting:** O(1)
- Only constant extra variables (loop counters, temp variables)

#### 2.2.2 Total Space
- **Input array:** O(n)
- **Stack space:** O(1) - iterative implementation
- **Total:** O(n)

### 2.3 Recurrence Relations

For recursive formulation (if applicable):
```
T(n) = T(n-1) + O(n)
T(1) = O(1)

Solution by substitution:
T(n) = O(n) + O(n-1) + O(n-2) + ... + O(1)
     = O(n²)
```

### 2.4 Comparison with Selection Sort

| Metric | Insertion Sort | Selection Sort |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Best Case Time | O(n) | O(n) with early term. |
| Avg Case Time | Θ(n²) | Θ(n²) |
| Worst Case Time | O(n²) | O(n²) |
| Comparisons (avg) | ~n²/4 | ~n²/2 |
| Swaps (avg) | ~n²/4 | n-1 |
| Stability | Stable | Unstable |
| Adaptivity | Highly adaptive | Less adaptive |

**Key Insights:**
- Insertion Sort performs better on nearly-sorted data
- Selection Sort has fewer swaps
- Insertion Sort is stable; Selection Sort is not

## 3. Code Review & Optimization (2 pages)

### 3.1 Code Structure Analysis

#### 3.1.1 Strengths
- ✅ Clear method decomposition
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Performance metrics integration

#### 3.1.2 Areas for Improvement
- ⚠️ Could optimize inner loop termination
- ⚠️ Binary insertion could reduce comparisons
- ⚠️ Sentinel value could eliminate boundary checks

### 3.2 Inefficiency Detection

#### 3.2.1 Bottleneck #1: Linear Search for Insertion Point
**Location:** `InsertionSort.java`, lines 45-52

**Current Implementation:**
```java
int j = i - 1;
while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
    arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
    j--;
}
```

**Issue:** Linear search takes O(i) time in worst case

**Impact:**
- Unnecessary comparisons when sorted portion is large
- Degrades to O(n²) even when only position finding is needed

#### 3.2.2 Bottleneck #2: Repeated Array Accesses
**Location:** Throughout the sorting loop

**Issue:** Multiple accesses to same array indices

**Optimization Opportunity:**
- Cache frequently accessed values
- Reduce array access overhead

### 3.3 Time Complexity Improvements

#### 3.3.1 Optimization: Binary Insertion Sort
**Suggestion:** Use binary search to find insertion point

**Proposed Implementation:**
```java
private int binarySearch(int[] arr, int item, int low, int high) {
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
        if (item < arr[mid]) {
            high = mid - 1;
        } else {
            low = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return low;
}
```

**Benefit:**
- Reduces comparisons from O(n) to O(log
